<h1> Hi, I’m Dillan Lacy 😁 </h1>

I am a second year student studying Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. Major technologies I am passionate about include C/C++ (Arduino Software w/ Projects), Javascript/HTML (Web-applications), and CAD tools like Onshape/Solidworks. I enjoy working alongside ColorStack @ UC San Diego to raise career-building awareness to underrepresented Computer Science/Engineering students at UCSD. I work seperately as R&D for the UCSD Seismic Design team, CADding models of viscoelastic dampers and data analysis. I am currently learning analog design and integration of I/O devices with software!
